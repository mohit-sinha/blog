Hey, I am Mohit Sinha. I am from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. I am a 22 years old undergrad at IIT Roorkee. My professional hobby is Machine Learning and programming. I like learning about different civilisations, culture, history and language. I speak English, Hindi and a little Spanish. On some fine days, you can find me humming songs too. I play keyboard and have an ear for good music. I am also a fitness enthusiast and like to hit the gym regularly.

I am an ambivert and I always look forward to feedbacks to improve myself. If you have one, kindly post it on my website.
