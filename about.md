Hey, I am Mohit Sinha. I am from Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. I am a 24 years old analyst at American Express, Gurugram, India. I graduated from IIT Roorkee in 2019 and now I make strategies for managing credit risk of applicants. This website is a mirror to my personal and professional life. You can find my life experiences in the blog section. If you have anything to say to me, feel free to use the social icons or go to 'Contact' page to write directly to me.

I play guitar and humm songs too. I am a keen spirituality enthusiast and fitness conscious.

I am always excited about meeting new people, do let me know if this description makes you want to grab a coffee together ;-)
