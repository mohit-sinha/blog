So here I was at the end of 7th semester of my undergrad life. It is the time when all the students start gearing up for the most awaited time of their entire college life. Building resume, preparing for screening test, preparing for interviews, calling up each and every senior to ask for tips.. ah, the good times.
Well, this time I was prepared. I had my hands dirty with all sorts of profile. I had prepared well for aptitude tests, and coding tests as well. Among the many things that I had anticipated, the most important one, that I had missed is that placement is a highly random process.
Evidently, Day 0 companies are reserved for people who are from circuit branches, or code like there is nothing else there in the world. I belonged to neither. I wrote a few tests and soon got shortlisted in 2 Day 1 companies. One is a tech giant, let's call it O. Other is a consulting giant, EXL services. If you are looking for takeaways, note that this kind of company combination is NOT GOOD AT ALL. You should have a single profile, either software or analyst. Otherwise, you will be facing heavy attrition on the interview days. One thing is for sure, even if you are great at coding or at aptitude tests, you can't be sure that in the tests, you will perform as good as you perform in the comfort of your room. There are simply too many factors and it is impossible to account for all.
I had taken almost all Day 0 and Day 1 company's test and I was exhausted. On top of it, came endsem examinations. I literally flew through the slides of the courses for which I haven't attended a single class. I completed my BTP report in a night. I had done everything a good student must not do with academics this semester.
It was November, and exams for companies of Day 2 and beyond started. I gave exams at odd times like 2 AM and then at 8 AM in the same morning. I appeared for around 25 exams for Day 2 and Day 3 companies. It is the time when you realize the value of leisure.
Finally, the day had come. It was 30th November, Day 0. I was still giving an exam for a company. I came to my room tired and exhausted and started preparing for the interviews the next day. It was nothing like I had expected, I was not in my best phase. I didn't have even a miniscule of energy left, I was hungry but I didn't feel like eating, instead I slept. I slept for 8 hours straight.

I will continue with the experience of interviews in the next blog.
Signing off.
