In the last blog, I talked about a tech giant, whose interview I had to face on Day 1. It wasn't my life's first interview, and I was not nervous at all. I knew I will do good and I reached the place with tremendous confidence. It was a chilly December morning, I was dressed up in my suit. When my name was called, I entered with a smiling face. Interviewer was a very friendly person.

He looked over my resume and stressed on the fact that I belonged to Metallurgical Engineering department and whether I would be comfortable with coding questions. Meh. He asked some other ice-breaking questions, and then we dived into coding questions. For each of the 3 problems he asked, I gave him various approaches with pros and cons for each of them. I was happy with my own answers and he was pretty impressed too, he said for himself. Then he asked me to design a library and abstained from answering any clarifying questions. I accepted the condition and went on structuring my thoughts and harnessing my critical thinking. Finally I came up with a design with use-cases and databases for each use-case. It was the time, I realized that this interview couldn't be better. He reciprocated well, and in his own words appreciated my design. He also asked my JEE rank.

So far so good, he then asked me something very strange. He asked whether you'd be interested in the profile and the company. I was not sure what he meant by that. He reconfirmed my JEE Rank and also said that it was a great discussion, and that I should wait and the HR will be interacting with me. I was elated. This naturally meant that I was almost selected. I knew I am good with HR rounds and therefore my hopes were soaring high. There was only one problem, I didn't understand his interest in JEE ranks. If this was the case, other candidates, who can't even explain how time complexity of an algorithm is calculated, but have better JEE ranks, might have better chances.

Evidently, I was called again for other interview. And no, this was not an HR round. The guy had a stern face and started off with the interview directly without greetings. He asked me a coding puzzle which let alone in the interview, if you don't know it beforehand, you can't come up with the solution in an hour even when you are sitting comfortably in your room. For all the approaches I was trying to come up with, his answer was only one thing. "No". He said that around 50 times in the 15min interview. I was not able to understand what is going on. He then asked me 2 other coding questions. I had done those before and I gave him the most optimal solution. To my surprise, he still said "No" and that I should optimize it more. I didn't know what to do more. He gazed slyly and asked me if I was done and whether I had any other questions, I coldly said no. I was not able to believe what just happened in these 15mins. Well, placements are random, a voice in my head reminded. I came back to my room.

As expected, I was not selected. My friends consoled me and helped me to spring back for the other interview.
The next interview was great. The first round was taken by a panel of two. I answered almost all the questions they asked confidently and also made them smile. The next interview was a quick one. It lasted for around 5-7mins and he asked about my intern and competitions that I have participated in. I knew I had impressed the interviewers.

I was done, and I came back to my room. To my surprise, the next day was unbelievably hectic for me. I had interviews with 9 different companies. I had no idea how it would be managed. Little did I know that it won't be needed. I slept. Just after an hour, there was banging on my door. I opened up and I started receiving hugs. I was selected for the post of consulting analyst at EXL.

I am very excited to start my career with EXL. It is a profile I am more comfortable in, as compared to software development.
I am really thankful to all my friends, families and seniors who guided me.

Signing off.
