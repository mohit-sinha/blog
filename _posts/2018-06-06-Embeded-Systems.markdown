As the need for smartness in devices is increasing, as well as the desired size of such devices is decreasing, embedded computer systems are an optimal way out. You don't need to waste time in communication between your devices if you give a small brain to the device itself. The aim of my project was to make a smart camera. This camera should be around the size of your fist and must be able to read QR codes/Pharma codes, detect labels, perform OCR (determine texts in visual feed) and pass the processed information to the main server, all at highest possible speed.
