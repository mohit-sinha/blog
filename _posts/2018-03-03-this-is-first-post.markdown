Hey, assuming we have not met before, I'd like to tell you a few things about me. I am an undergrad at IIT Roorkee. My prime professional interest is programming. When i am not writing code, I love to spend time on Quora or watch movies.

Programming is one of the most appealing things to me since childhood. I realized my love for computers soon after I got my first PC in  2005, when I was in fourth standard. I didn't use computer like the most people around me were using, instead I used to dive deep into the functioning of softwares. I broke and repaired my computer several times until I finally messed with the motherboard which caused it to overheat and my father had to buy a new one. Though he never got angry, and still supports me when I wish to try new things out.

Since the time I've cleared JEE, programming has been on top of my priority list. I have been bestowed upon with a superb programming culture here in IITR. If I put it in fancy words, if you throw a stone in IITR, it will either hit a programmer or a single guy. This culture has been a key component in building me for what I am. I tried various things, andriod app development, front-end development, back-end development, data science and information security. Well, the only thing that fits exactly into me is algorithms. I drool over algorithms. May it be a machine learning or deep learning algorithm, or a problem solving algorithm for competitive programming, I enjoy writing and reading about them.

In the blog section, you will get to see various algorithms and their implementation in layman's term. I am a fan of simplicity and I will keep things as simple as possible. If you are a beginner in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning or Algorithms & Data Structures, do bookmark this website. If you are an employer or a person seeking professional help, do write to me on msinha132@gmail.com

I'll be signing off for now. Have a nice day.
