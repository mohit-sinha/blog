I have always been a fan of humble beginnings. I will like to take it slow. I’ll introduce myself in a way which will be of best interest to you.

I am NOT just another guy. I am different. It doesn’t mean I am completely different. I’ll explain that when I write about band theory. If you came here for regular cliches, then you should turn back. Things are real here. Reality is not always pleasing to the eyes.

I write about regular observations. What’s interesting in it, you ask? Well, my point of view is not ordinary. I don’t know if you’ll agree to the things I say, but I’m sure that if you do, it’ll benefit you.
