I had had quite a lot of ups and downs in selecting right path for my career. No, programming is not a leaf. It is just a node in the tree of career choices. This "try'em all" practice led me into a state where I was jack of many trades, but mastery was far. Well, I must warn you that this blog is gonna be a little sad at first, but it will get better. From september of 2017, I started sitting for campus internship tests. I cleared a few, however, interviewers found out how blunt my shape of career was and turned me down. Some wanted me to work in DBMS, and they would take me, to whom I politely declined. One guy even told me that I was trying "too hard", well whatever he meant.

So there I was, amidst tyranny of life, with no summer plans, when it struck me that this is going quite poor. I started solving more and more questions on Hackerrank. I refreshed all my concepts of binary trees, graphs and dynamic programming from Geeksforgeeks. However, some time or the other I would pick up bible of algorithms, yeah, I am talking about the famous CLRS, and give it a read. Your professors and seniors are not wrong, it sure is a masterpiece. You should go through it from time to time, and definitely make notes if you find something interesting. My rank improved on Hackerrank. It is silly how a few good digits can boost up your confidence. Well now I was equipped with atleast one thing in a good manner.

It was now when I started applying for almost all companies that were less data science/software development and more R&D of deep learning. I even bagged a decent winter internship at AimsQuant, a Bengaluru based startup. Most interviewers would ask questions related to algorithms which I was now able to answer well. While all this was going on, I received a mail that I was selected for summer research internship at Spookfish Innovations which is a startup, working in the field of computer vision. I had been giving a lot of telephonic interviews, and I remembered that the interview had gone well. It was all what I wanted. They were building a computer vision application, human pose detection to be exact. They had still not developed a marketable product and research was ongoing. This was exactly what I had put the bait for. I finally caught the fish which I wanted, it was Spookfish.

This winter vacations, I decided to stay at campus and learn more about computer vision. I enrolled remotely into Stanford's CSN231n class for convolutional neural network. It is one of the finest course, prepared to instigate both researchers and corporates who wish to implicate CNNs. Later, I started looking for open source repositories that were built using CNN. I planned to contribute to them. However, I realized I will require more in-depth knowledge for such projects, so when spring sem began, I enrolled into Geoffery Hinton's Neural Network course. It is then I realized how wonderful and innovative deep learning is. I finally found what I wanted to do for the next many years. I completed it with score 9/10. Pretty good for a novoice like me, I thought to myself.

The next few months went away with a little less productivity, majorly because of the trip to Goa, regular gym and hectic academics. I improved my CGPA, but still I had more forts to capture. Now I am leaving for Bengaluru. I hope it will have what I wish.

Signing off.
